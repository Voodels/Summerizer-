## 11. Getting LLM Assistance

When using this document with an LLM (like Claude), you can ask for:

1. **Implementation guidance**: "Help me implement the transcription engine component."
2. **Problem solving**: "How should I handle memory issues with 12-hour videos?"
3. **Code review**: "Review my implementation of the chunking mechanism."
4. **Architecture advice**: "Suggest improvements to my fault tolerance approach."
5. **Testing strategies**: "How should I test the transcription quality?"

For best results, provide:
- The specific component you're working on
- Current implementation details or code snippets
- Specific challenges you're facing
- Your system constraints (memory, CPU, etc.)
